                            incorporating the Terms of Service, KeyedIn will be entitled to the remedies described

                            such written agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer will be deemed to be in default
                            on the earliest occurrence of any of the following: (a) Customer fails to pay the Service
                            Provider Fees when due; (b) Customer fails to pay a balance that is due or to rectify,
                            within a reasonable period of time after accrual of the charge, a transaction aborted
                            because a credit or debit card is declined or expired; (c) Customer fails to pay an invoice
                            issued to the Customer by KeyedIn within the time period agreed or, if no period is agreed,
                            within 30 days; (d) Customer initiates a chargeback with a bank or other financial
                            institution resulting in a charge made by KeyedIn for Service Provider Fees or such other
                            amount due being reversed to the Customer; or (e) Customer takes other actions or fails to
                            take any action that results in a negative or past-due balance on the Customer&rsquo;s
                            account.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Customer is in default, KeyedIn may, without notice,
                            temporarily or permanently close Customer&rsquo;s Account and revoke Customer&rsquo;s
                            access, including Customer&rsquo;s authority to use the App to process any additional
                            payments, enter into Service Contracts, or obtain any additional Service Provider services
                            from other Users through the App. However, Customers will remain responsible for any amounts
                            that accrue on any ongoing transaction at the time a limitation is put on the
                            Customer&rsquo;s Account as a result of the default. Without prejudice to other available
                            remedies, Customer must pay KeyedIn upon demand for any amounts owed, plus interest on the
                            outstanding amount at the prevailing market rate plus legal fees and other costs of
                            collection to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KeyedIn may make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies
                            and law enforcement authorities; and cooperate with them in any investigation or

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KeyedIn does not guarantee that Customer is able to pay or will
                            pay Service Provider Fees and KeyedIn is not liable for Service Provider fees if Customer is

                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service Providers may use the dispute process as described in the
                            Service Contract in order to recover fees from Customers in the event of a default or may
                            pursue such other remedies against Customer as they choose. If KeyedIn recovers fees from a
                            Customer in default KeyedIn will disburse any portion attributable to Service Provider Fees
                            to the applicable Service Provider to the extent not already paid by Customer or credited by

                            recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or

                            of the Services, you may elect to bring those claims in a court of competent jurisdiction
                            instead of arbitration. KeyedIn agrees to honour your election of forum with respect to your
                            crime, violence, sexual assault or sexual harassment claim but in so doing does not waive
